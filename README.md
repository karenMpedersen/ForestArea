# Why Data Resolution Matters

This repository demonstrates how the **choice of spatial data resolution** can dramatically affect estimates of tree cover and subsequent ecological interpretations.  
Using two global land-cover datasets ‚Äî **MODIS (500 m)** and **ESA WorldCover (10 m)** ‚Äî this notebook walks through how to calculate, visualize, and compare forest extent for the same study area.

This project outputs two different calcultions for tree cover.

## üîç Overview

The notebook performs three main tasks:

1. **Visualize the study site** ‚Äî display a high-resolution reference image from Esri World Imagery.  
2. **Calculate forest area** using two datasets with different spatial resolutions.  
3. **Compare results** to illustrate how data resolution influences ecological conclusions.

 This can be reproduced with your own area of interest, and your own study sites.
