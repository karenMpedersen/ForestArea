# Why Data Resolution Matters

This repository demonstrates how the **choice of spatial data resolution** can dramatically affect estimates of tree cover and subsequent ecological interpretations.  
Using two global land-cover datasets ‚Äî **MODIS (500 m)** and **ESA WorldCover (10 m)** ‚Äî this notebook walks through how to calculate, visualize, and compare forest extent for the same study area.

This project outputs two different calcultions for tree cover.

### Visual Comparison of Tree Cover Estimates

The area shown in the images covers approximately **370 km¬≤**.  
A large portion of the **upper right** appears densely tree-covered, while the **lower left** contains noticeably less forest in the satellite image from World Imagery.  
This spatial pattern is reflected in both output maps, where **green** indicates tree cover and **black** represents all other land-cover types.

Placing the **MODIS** and **ESA WorldCover** products side by side makes the difference in resolution and classification readily apparent.  
The **MODIS** dataset estimates **105 km¬≤** of tree cover (about **28%** of the total area), whereas the **ESA** dataset estimates **318 km¬≤** (approximately **86%**).  
This contrast highlights how data resolution and classification methods can dramatically affect forest-cover estimates and their ecological interpretation.

## üîç Overview

The notebook performs three main tasks:

1. **Visualize the study site** ‚Äî display a high-resolution reference image from Esri World Imagery.  
2. **Calculate forest area** using two datasets with different spatial resolutions.  
3. **Compare results** to illustrate how data resolution influences ecological conclusions.

 This can be reproduced with your own area of interest, and your own study sites.
